# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** The Quant Agent must produce statistically grounded +EV flags backed entirely by database-sourced data — zero LLM hallucination, zero flat bet sizing, strict Kelly Criterion outputs.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Data Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Data Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-10 — Roadmap created, all 23 v1 requirements mapped to 6 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: LangGraph for orchestration — directed graph maps to multi-agent routing
- [Init]: Pydantic on all LLM outputs — prevents hallucinated stats reaching SQL
- [Init]: NFL-first, NBA deferred — validate pipeline on one sport first
- [Init]: Backend-first, no frontend in v1 — validate math before UX investment

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Verify current LangGraph version (may be 0.3.x by implementation) — confirm AsyncPostgresSaver import path and Send API for parallel fan-out before coding graph infrastructure
- [Phase 4]: Verify current Odds API sport key naming and rate limits against live API documentation before implementing polling loop
- [Phase 6]: Verify nfl_data_py NGS field availability for current seasons before designing Kinematic Agent queries
